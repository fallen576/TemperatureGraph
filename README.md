# TemperatureGraph
Site that displays real time temperature data from an Arduino.

I got my inspiration from a Youtuber named Michael Reeves where he created a cup that tazed you if you didn't drink it fast enough. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0eSPogdaHs

At 3:31 minutes in the video he demonstrates how the sensor reads when the cup if full of liquid and how the real time graph decreases as he pours it out. This is exactly where I got the idea from. The main difference is mine is just reading temperature.

# What its built on should probably go here at somepoint
